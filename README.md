Welcome to this repository! 🚀 This project showcases the three unique and impactful applications: Iris Classification, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and Sales Prediction. 
Each task explores different facets of data analysis and prediction, giving you a well-rounded understanding of ML techniques.


1. Iris Classification 
The Iris Dataset is a classic machine learning problem.
- Predict the species of a flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.
- Use a Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.
- Evaluate the model with metrics like accuracy score and visualize results with a confusion matrix and feature importance chart.


2. Credit Card Fraud Detection 
Fraud detection is critical for financial security. 
- Build a classification model (Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Handle data preprocessing challenges like imbalanced datasets.
- Evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure accuracy in fraud detection.


3. Sales Prediction 
Understanding sales trends is vital for businesses.
- Use Linear Regression to predict sales based on features like advertising budget and promotional spend.
- Apply K-Means Clustering to group data into meaningful clusters, identifying patterns like “high sales, low spend.”
- Visualize actual vs predicted sales and analyze performance with MSE and R² Score.
